# Final Project: Ironhack Data Analytics Fall 2021 Part Time

Data Source: In 2014, Harvard Dataverse de-identified data acculumated from students who took HarvardX and MITX courses in 2013. HarvardX and MiTX courses are free massive open online courses (MOOC).To comply with Harvard's Dataverses terms and conditions, I will not share the dataset on the repository but will share the source where there is document on the methodology of the data acculumulation, the description of variables, and the dataset in .csv form. In order to download all documents, one must create a free account with Harvard Dataverse.

Problem Statement: I want to predict what courses will be the most popular in 2014 based on 2013 data.
